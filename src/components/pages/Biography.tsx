    <Paragraph>
      Frances Kornbluth was born in New York City on July 26, 1920. As a child,
      Kornbluth developed a passion for the piano, and graduated from Brooklyn
      College in 1940 with a degree in music. During World War II, she married,
      and—while her husband was overseas—worked in Washington DC for the Lend
      Lease Organization and then the Office of Strategic Services. After the
      war, Kornbluth and her husband moved to Merrick, NY where they had two
      children.

      In 1947, Kornbluth enrolled in an art workshop on Long Island and began
      painting figures and still lives in the studio. In 1955, she enrolled in
      the Brooklyn Museum School, where she studied for four years with William
      Kienbusch and Reuben Tam. During this time, Kornbluth painted in and out
      of the studio—including the Freeport marshes and Jones Beach—and her work
      became increasingly abstract. It was Tam who encouraged Kornbluth to
      exhibit her work at the Brooklyn Museum and the City Center Gallery, in
      addition to introducing her to Maine’s Monhegan Island in 1957—she would
      later credit Tam with: “defining me as the artist I had never envisioned
      becoming.” Kornbluth also studied with Robert Richenburg at the Pratt
      Institute, where she received a master’s degree in 1962. In 1969,
      Kornbluth and her family moved from Merrick, NY to North Grosvenordale,
      CT, where she would maintain a winter studio for the rest of her life.

    <Paragraph>
      For 57 years, Kornbluth spent her summers on Monhegan Island, renting in
      different locations until 1974 when she purchased a cottage in Lobster
      Cove and established a permanent summer studio. Imagery from Monhegan
      Island—including Lobster Cove, Burnt Head, White Head and Ice Pond—recur
      in different ways throughout her work.

      The Dominican Republic is another location that recurs in Kornbluth’s
      work. She was an artist in residence at Altos de Chavon, an artists&apos;
      village in La Romana, during the fall of 1985.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      On May 26, 2014, Kornbluth died in Dayville, CT at the age of 93. During
      her lifetime, she was a member of the National Association of Women
      Artists, a charter member of the National Museum of Women in the Arts and
      a founding member of Women Artists of Monhegan Island.
